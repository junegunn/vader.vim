# Test case
Execute (Assert and AssertEqual command):
  Assert 1 == 1
  AssertEqual 'hey', tolower('HEY')
  AssertEqual 'vader.vader', fnamemodify(g:vader_file, ':t')
  AssertThrows call reverse('not a list')

Execute (FIXME: AssertThrows expects an exception to be thrown):
  AssertThrows call reverse([1, 2, 3])

Execute (FIXME: Optional message parameter to Assert command):
  Assert 1 == 2, '1 is not equal to 2'

Execute (Save global option values before changing them):
  Save &expandtab, &tabstop
  set expandtab shiftwidth=2

Given ruby (Block content is injected and highlighted as ruby code):
  def a
    a = 1
    end

Do (Do block content is keystrokes in normal mode):
  vip
  =

Expect ruby (Expect block content should match the result of previous Do block):
  def a
    a = 1
  end

Expect ruby (Previous Given block is repeated, thus this should fail):
  def b
    a = 1
  end

Do (Indent and shift given ruby code):
  vip
  =
  gv
  >

Expect ruby (indented and shifted):
    def a
      a = 1
    end

Do (FIXME: Execute a non-existent command should raise an error):
  :non-existent-command\<Enter>

Execute (Revert changed option values):
  Restore
